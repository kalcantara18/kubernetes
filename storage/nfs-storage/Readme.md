# NFS Dynamic Storage Provisioner

#### **❗❗ This is now deprecated in favor of [NFS External Storage Provisioner](../nfs-external-storage/Readme.md)**

## Introduction
This Provisions an NFS Server inside of your cluster. The twist here is that it deploys it strictly on your master node which is already holding your etcd data anyway. Ultimately, this means than when PVCs are requested, this provisioner creates a directory under `/storage/dynamic` on your master node and stores whatever data it gets over the network. This makes the storage Node Failure Resistant i.e. even if the Node completely crashes or is completely replaced, you will not lose data. However, __the crashing of the master node itself will result in permanent data loss__. That said, crashing the master node is virtually the same as crashing the cluster. So this just means you should backup the master node regularly

## Installation

Simply run

```
kubectl apply -k nfs-storage
```

## Taints and Tolerations

The deployment definition uses tolerations to deploy the storage on the master node depending on the configuration of your cluster you might need to change them

The current tolerations are based on rancher generated clusters (rancher or rke) so if the cluster was deployed differently you might need to first find out the taints on the master node. e.g.


You can check the taints on the master node with the following
```bash
# Get all nodes
kubectl get nodes

# Describe Master node
kubectl describe node $MasterNode
```
In the case of rancher you'll see something like

```
Taints:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd=true:NoExecute
    node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane=true:NoSchedule
```

This translates to the following tolerations in the `deployment.yaml` file

```yaml
tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd
      operator: Equal
      value: "true"
      effect: NoExecute
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/controlplane
      operator: Equal
      value: "true"
      effect: NoSchedule
```
So if your setup is different then you will need to change it accordingly
